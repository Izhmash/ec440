Current state:
* Single commands with arguments work
* Running programs in the background work
* Input redirection and output redirection works on single commands
* A single pipe between two commands will work
* Unknown commands will raise an error and prompt the user again

Issues:
* Piping with more than two commands does not work
* Piping always outputs as if the '&' was included
* Piping mixed with redirection causes unexpected behavior
