Issues: it currently fails the round-robin test on Bandit.
Although I have a ualarm setup to interrupt the current thread
every 50 ms, it seems that the other thread is not being given
any execution time.
Besides that issue, however, many threads can be created, multiple
stacks can be allocated at once, and the main thread is solid
without seg faults.
